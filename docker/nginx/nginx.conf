#### Storefront configuration ####
#
# Create new "fake" upstream allow to bypass long-term bug in nginx
# when alias and try_files don't work as expected.
# All traffic from "storefront" location (line 48 in this file) is proxy-passed
# to this server configuration, where is different root set.
#
# All of this is to achieve following functionality:
#  - Symfony application still works on every url except "/storefront/*" (admin, graphql api, frontend)
#  - Each request from /storefront/ location is tried for presence of file (static files - css, js, images)
#    - if file exists is served
#    - if not, request is redirected to index.html file - Vue router take care of routing and serving proper page
